<h1>JavaScript Blackjack Game</h1>

<p>The game of Blackjack built with vanilla JavaScript. Does not currently have a betting feature, but it is still fun, so go ahead and play a few rounds!</p>

<p>Check out the website <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DevJHennessy/JavaScript-Blackjack-Game/blob/master/index.html">here</a>. Note: the GitHub Previewer has a bug and does not like the relative URL usage for CSS images. To make the background show up properly, inspect the page with developer tools and navigate to the body element and delete one of the periods for the URL in the background-image property - should look like: background-image: url(./images/Cardtable-BG.png);</p>
